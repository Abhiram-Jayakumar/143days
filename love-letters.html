      <h2>Letter</h2>
     <p>From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew my life was about to change in the most beautiful way. Each day with you feels like a dream come true, and I find myself falling more in love with you every single moment.

      I love you more than words can express. Your smile lights up my world, and your laughter is the sweetest melody I've ever heard. When I'm with you, everything feels right, and my heart feels at home.
      
      One of my greatest joys is kissing you. Every kiss we share is a reminder of the deep connection we have. It's in those tender moments when our lips meet that I feel our souls intertwine. Your kisses are intoxicating, and I can't get enough of them. They are sweet, passionate, and filled with love. Each kiss makes me want to hold you closer and never let go.
      
      I adore cuddling with you. There is nothing more comforting than being wrapped in your arms, feeling your warmth and heartbeat. Those quiet moments we spend together, just holding each other, are my favorite. Whether we're watching a movie, talking about our day, or simply lying in silence, your embrace is my sanctuary. Itâ€™s in those cuddles that I find peace, love, and an unspoken promise that we are always there for each other.
      
      You are my everything, Pooju. My best friend, my confidant, my love. Every day, I thank the stars for bringing you into my life. I cherish every moment we spend together and look forward to creating countless more memories with you.
      
      I love you with all my heart, and I promise to continue loving you more with each passing day. Your love is my greatest treasure, and I am forever grateful for it.
      
      With all my love and endless kisses,</p>

      <h2>Letter-2</h2>
     <p> PoojuuðŸ˜˜,

      Iâ€™m still in awe of the beautiful surprise you planned for my birthday. When you didnâ€™t show up initially and left my gift with Aliyan, I was honestly a bit confused and disappointed. But when you suddenly appeared in the lift with that stunning bouquet of flowers, it was like a dream come true. I was so shocked and surprised that I accidentally stepped on the cake!
      
      Despite the unexpected twists, I still remember the warmth and love you brought to that day. The smell of you, the heartfelt gestures, and the effort you put into making everything perfect are etched in my memory. You truly made my day special in a way no one ever has before.
      
      Your handcrafted magazine and the bouquet you made yourself were beyond amazing. The fact that you learned crafting just for me shows how deeply you care, and Iâ€™m so touched by your thoughtfulness and creativity. Your love and dedication mean the world to me.
      
      Thank you for making my birthday so unforgettable and for filling it with love and joy. I canâ€™t express enough how much I appreciate everything you did for me. I am truly blessed to have you in my life, and I want you to know that I will cherish these memories forever.
      
      <br><b>I LOVE YOU poojamma..ðŸ’•ðŸ˜˜</b></p>
