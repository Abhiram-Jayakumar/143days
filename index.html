        <h2><b>How It All Began</b> </h2>
        <p>
         <b>It all started 1 years 2 months 9 days ago when we first spoke...</b> </p>
        <p>[
          The first message you texted me was, "Is that Interstellar?" Do you remember? It was the first message you sent to me. After that, we became good friends and good souls. But it all started with a bet you made. You bet that if I made you fall in love with me before December 31, I would win. At first, it was just a bet for me. But as I got to know you more and more, I saw a part of myself in you. I felt a little love and care from you, and that was enough for me to fall for you.

          I started to crazily love you. Every time you said you didn't feel my love, I just fell more and more for you. Each time, I tried to make you fall in love with me, but I was deeply in love with you. I love you a lot, more than I can say, even now. I love you like the earth loves the moon. I'm not going to mention those four breakups we had üòÅü§£.
          
          Do you remember our first date? We were so nervous, but it turned out to be magical. And our first trip together‚Äîevery moment felt like an adventure. The small, unexpected surprises you brought into my life made every day special.
          
          One of my favorite memories is when we stayed up all night talking about our dreams and fears. It was in those moments that I realized how deeply I care for you. I cherish the way you laugh, the way you look at me when you think I'm not noticing, and the way your hand fits perfectly in mine.
          
          I know we've had our ups and downs, but each challenge has made us stronger. Our love isn't perfect, but it's real, and it's ours. I wouldn't trade it for anything.
          
          Looking forward, I can‚Äôt wait to see where life takes us. I dream about the places we'll go, the things we'll see, and the life we'll build together. Every moment with you is a treasure, and I can't wait to create more memories with you.
          
          You are my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest love. Thank you for being on this journey with me. Here's to many more days, months, and years of love and laughter.
          I love you Pooju üòò          ]</p>
